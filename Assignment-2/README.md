# Task 1

# Genes Dataset Pipeline
1. Install requirements
2. Run genes_pipeline.py to run an example pipeline. Note that the grid search in this file is set to a smaller grid search, for testing, as the full grid search consists of over 150 models and, depending on the cross-validation method, may use leave-one-out cross-validation. Please read the comments in the genes_pipeline file for further clarification.
3. Results of the grid search can be found in Genes_results folder, but note that the Leave-One-Out cross-validation results are not available as the file was too large to push to github.
4. Plots are saved in Genes_results
5. To run full code on habrok, you can use the files in the habrok_jobs folder, which make use of the run_gridsearch.py file.
